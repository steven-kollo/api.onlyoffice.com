The user initiates a long-running operation by sending a request to the appropriate API endpoint, which returns an object containing information about the initiated operation. An [example](/docspace/method/files/put/api/2.0/files/rooms/%7bid%7d/archive) of such a request and response:

Example Request

```
PUT api/2.0/files/rooms/1234/archive
Host: yourportal.onlyoffice.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "DeleteAfter": true
}
```

Example Response

```
{
    "error": "",
    "finished": false,
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "operation": 0,
    "processed": "0",
    "progress": 0
}
```

The following endpoints return the operation status:

* [PUT api/2.0/files/rooms/\{id}/archive](/docspace/method/files/put/api/2.0/files/rooms/%7bid%7d/archive)
* [PUT api/2.0/files/fileops/delete](/docspace/method/files/put/api/2.0/files/fileops/delete)
* [DELETE api/2.0/files/file/\{fileid}](/docspace/method/files/delete/api/2.0/files/file/%7bfileid%7d)

## Monitoring the operation status

To track the operation progress, you must periodically execute a GET request to the following [endpoint](/docspace/method/files/get/api/2.0/files/fileops):

```
GET api/2.0/files/fileops
```

This request returns an array of the current operations as objects similar to the one described above.

In this array, the ID of the previously initiated operation is returned. If *finished* is not true, or *progress* or *percents* is not 100, wait a while and then execute the *files/fileops/* request again. This loop is repeated until the operation completes or the error text appears in the *error* property.
