The user needs to perform several easy steps to pass authentication:

1. Send POST request, containing the **userName** and **password** parameters to the [api/2.0/authentication](/portals/method/authentication/post/api/2.0/authentication) address:

   Example Authentication Request

   ```
   POST /api/2.0/authentication.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: yourportal.onlyoffice.com
   Content-Type: application/json
   Accept: application/json

   {
       "userName": "yourusername",
       "password": "yourpassword"
   }
   ```

   Please note, that you have to enter your own portal address to the *Host: yourportal.onlyoffice.com* line instead of *yourportal.onlyoffice.com* address.

   Example Response

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 201 Created
   Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
   {
       "count": 1,
       "response": {
           "expires": "2010-07-07T17:06:03.5845502+03:00",
           "token": "sdjhfskjdhkqy739459234"
       },
       "status": 0,
       "statusCode": 201
   }
   ```

2. In case authentication is successful, a token which will look like **sdjhfskjdhkqy739459234** will be received.

3. Use this token every time you call API methods inserting it to the **Authorization** HTTP header:

   Example API Request

   ```
   GET api/2.0/people/@self.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: yourportal.onlyoffice.com
   Accept: application/json
   Authorization:sdjhfskjdhkqy739459234
   ```

   Please note, that you have to enter your own portal address to the *Host: yourportal.onlyoffice.com* line instead of *yourportal.onlyoffice.com* address.

C# authentication request example

```
var request = System.Net.WebRequest.Create("https://yourportal.onlyoffice.com/api/2.0/authentication.json");
request.Method = "POST";
request.ContentType = "application/json";

var body = "{\"userName\":\"yourusername\",\"password\":\"yourpassword\"}";
var data = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(body);

request.ContentLength = data.Length;
using (var stream = request.GetRequestStream())
{
    stream.Write(data, 0, data.Length);
}

var response = (System.Net.HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
var responseString = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()).ReadToEnd();
```

Please note, that you have to enter your own portal address instead of *yourportal.onlyoffice.com* address.

cURL authentication request example

```
curl --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data "{\"username\":\"yourusername\",\"password\":\"yourpassword\"}" "https://yourportal.onlyoffice.com/api/2.0/authentication.json"
```

Please note, that you have to enter your own portal address instead of *yourportal.onlyoffice.com* address.
