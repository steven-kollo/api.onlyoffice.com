  When connecting your ownCloud/Nextcloud installation to ONLYOFFICE Docs, you need to make sure that the server with ONLYOFFICE Docs installed is accessible both for the internet browsers and ownCloud/Nextcloud installations, i.e. the requests can be sent to and the responses can be accepted from the computer with ONLYOFFICE Docs installed.
