To prevent the substitution of important parameters in ONLYOFFICE Docs requests an encrypted signature is added to it in the form of **token**.

The **token** is added in the configuration when initializing **Document Editor** and during the exchange of commands between **document storage service** and **document editing service**, **document command service**, **document conversion service** and **document builder service**.

The **token** is generated using the *JWT* ([JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)) standard. The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the client is able to verify that the token is legitimate.

*JSON Web Tokens* consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: *header*, *payload*, *signature*. The *header* consists of two parts: the type of the token (*JWT*), and the hashing algorithm (*HMAC SHA256*). The second part of the token is the *payload*, which contains the claims in JSON format. To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

**ONLYOFFICE Docs** validates the **token**. The data from the *payload* is considered valid and is used instead of the corresponding data from the main parameters. If the **token** is invalid, the command is not executed.

See the [Signature](/editors/signature/) configuration section to find more.

Please note that using the **local links** by the integrator requires the *JWT* in the config. Otherwise, an error will occur.

Be sure to add a token when using local links in the following methods: [insertImage](/editors/methods#insertImage), [setHistoryData](/editors/methods#setHistoryData), [setMailMergeRecipients](/editors/methods#setMailMergeRecipients), [setReferenceData](/editors/methods#setReferenceData), [setReferenceSource](/editors/methods#setReferenceSource), [setRequestedDocument](/editors/methods#setRequestedDocument), [setRequestedSpreadsheet](/editors/methods#setRequestedSpreadsheet), [setRevisedFile](/editors/methods#setRevisedFile). Moreover, it is necessary when defining the local url for [opening](/editors/config/document#url) or [conversion](/editors/conversionapi#url).
