## Health check

To check if the editors are available, send the GET request to */healthcheck*. This request checks the availability of the databases, message broker, Redis connection, and storage.

The response must be **true**, which means that the editors are ready to use.

If something went wrong, make sure that you have followed the installation instructions above.
