# [](/editors/wopi/restapi)RenameFile

**POST /wopi/files/*(file\_id)***

Renames a file.

This operation works as follows:

1. The WOPI host checks if a file is currently locked or not.
2. If the file is currently **locked** and the **X-WOPI-Lock** value does not match the lock currently on the file, the host must return **409 Conflict** (*"lock mismatch"*) and include the **X-WOPI-Lock** response header containing the value of the current lock on the file.
3. If the file is **unlocked**, the host should respond with **200 OK** and proceed with the rename.
4. If the host cannot rename the file because the name requested is invalid or conflicts with the existing file, the host should try to generate a different name based on the requested name that meets the file name requirements.
5. If the host cannot generate a different name, it should return **400 Bad Request**. The response must include the **X-WOPI-InvalidFileNameError** header that describes why the file name was invalid.
