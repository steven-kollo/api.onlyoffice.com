#### CDocBuilderContextScope^ CreateScope();

Creates a [context scope](/docbuilder/integrationapi/net/cdocbuildercontextscope) which sets the execution context for all operations executed within a local scope.

Please note, that for the *.docbuilder* file the *CDocBuilderContext.CreateScope* method is not used.

## Example

#### .Net

```
string workDirectory = "C:/Program Files/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentBuilder";
CDocBuilder.Initialize(workDirectory);
CDocBuilder oBuilder = new CDocBuilder();
CContext oContext = oBuilder.GetContext();
CContextScope oScope = oContext.CreateScope();
CDocBuilder.Destroy();
```
