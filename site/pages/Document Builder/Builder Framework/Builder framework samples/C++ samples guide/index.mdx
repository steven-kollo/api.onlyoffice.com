## Before you start

For the samples to work correctly, make sure that two conditions are met:

1. [ONLYOFFICE Document Builder](https://www.onlyoffice.com/download-builder.aspx?utm_source=api) is installed into default directory **"C:/Program Files/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentBuilder"** on your computer.

2. **The directory** in which you are going to store the downloaded samples **has general editing access** to save files created by the Document Builder.

## Download a sample

Download one of the Builder C++ samples archive and unzip it into a folder with general editing access.

## Sample structure

![C++ Builder sample structure](/content/img/docbuilder/cpp/sample_structure.png)

Each sample includes a **code folder**, an **sln file**, and a **template file** if the sample uses a template.\
The code folder consists of a **C++ program file** and **project files**.

![C++ Builder project file](/content/img/docbuilder/cpp/project_file.png)

Please note that the **path to the DocBuilder .dll file in the project file is set to default**. You can change the path in the **Sample.vcxproj.user** file if DocBuilder is located in a different directory on your computer.

## Program structure

![C# Builder program file](/content/img/docbuilder/cpp/program_file.png)

* Include doctrenderer library [C++ wrapper](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c)

* Specify the paths to the Document Builder **work directory**, the **result path** (where the generated file will be saved), and the optional **template path** (if a template file will be used).

* Create the **main function** (this function works with the DocBuilder methods to edit documents).

![C# Builder builder function](/content/img/docbuilder/cpp/builder_function.png)

* [Initialize](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuilder/initialize) the [DocBuilder](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuilder) from the working directory. After that Builder opens or creates a file so that [Context](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuildercontext), [Scope](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuildercontext/createscope) and [Global](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuildercontext/getglobal) classes can be accessed.

* Edit file using DocBuilder API methods. Use [Call](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuildervalue/call) method with the name and params of the API method you call as an arguments.

* [Save](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuilder/savefile) and [close](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuilder/closefile) file after editing, then call the [Dispose](/docbuilder/integrationapi/c/cdocbuilder/dispose) method to destroy DocBuilder.

## Run the sample

Open .sln file inside the sample folder to build the project.\
Run the program when the project is built.

## Check the result

After program execution the result file will be saved to the **result path**. It's sample folder root by default.

![C# Builder sample structure result file](/content/img/docbuilder/cpp/sample_structure_after.png) ![C# Builder sample folder result file](/content/img/docbuilder/cpp/folder_root_after.png)

Open **result file** and check the result.
