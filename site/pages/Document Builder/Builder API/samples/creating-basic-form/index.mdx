Create a basic form with the image and text inputs:

* create a new document, add text to the first paragraph and style it as heading ([ApiDocument](/docbuilder/textdocumentapi/apidocument), [ApiStyle](/docbuilder/textdocumentapi/apistyle), [ApiParagraph](/docbuilder/textdocumentapi/apiparagraph));
* create an image form and a text form, and add the form to the document ([Api/CreatePictureForm](/docbuilder/formapi/api/createpictureform), [Api/CreateTextForm](/docbuilder/formapi/api/createtextform)).

This sample is available for the **C++ and .Net DocBuilder Frameworks**.\
